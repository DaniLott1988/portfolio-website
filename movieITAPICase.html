        Case Study: Movie IT API

          Overview
        </h2>

        <p>
          The Movie IT API is a component of a web application designed to show data about movies and also record data about users.  
        </p>

      </div>

      <div class="context">
        
        <h2>
          Context
        </h2>

        <p>
          This project was the first of three connected projects I built as part of my Full Stack Web Development course at CareerFoundry. In this step it was built the API which would later allow the client-side to be built in both the MERN and MEAN stacks.
        </p>

      </div>

      <div class="objective">
        
        <h2>
          Objective
        </h2>

        <p>
          The goal of this project was to prepare the base of a complete application (added to the following projects) be it with either the MEAN or the MERN stacks. 
        </p>

      <div class="approach">
        
        <h2>
          Approach

        <p>
          The RESTful API was created using Node.js and Express and interacting with MongoDB. CRUD methods are used to retrived and store data. And information is provided by the API in JSON format. The tests were performed using Postman and API was deployed to Heroku.

          Challenges
        </h2>

        <p>
          To be honest, this was my favorite project throughout the course and as such, I went through it very fast. My biggest challenge was knowing how to pace myself.

        <h2>
          Duration

        <p>
          It was one of projects I did the fastest, both because I really enjoyed it and because it well explained.
